    # Remez filter description
    # ========================
    #
    # So, let's go over the inputs that you'll have to worry about.
    # First is numtaps. This parameter will basically determine how good your
    # filter is and how much processor power it takes up. If you go for some
    # obscene number of taps (in the thousands) there's other things to worry
    # about, but with sane numbers (probably below 30-50 in your case) that is
    # pretty much what it affects (more taps is better, but more expensive
    #         processing wise). There are other ways to do filters as well
    # which require less CPU power if you really need it, but I doubt that you
    # will. Filtering signals basically breaks down to convolution, and apple
    # has DSP libraries to do lightning fast convolution I'm sure, so don't
    # worry about this too much. Numtaps is basically equivalent to the number
    # of terms in the convolution, so a power of 2 is a good idea, 32 is
    # probably fine.
    #
    # bands has literally your list of bands, so you'll break it up into your
    # low band, your pass band, and your high band. Something like [0, 99, 100,
    # 999, 1000, 22049] should work, if you want to pass frequencies between
    # 100-999 Hz (assuming you are sampling at 44.1 kHz).
    #
    # desired will just be [0, 1, 0] as you want to drop the high and low
    # bands, and keep the middle one without modifying the amplitude.
    #
    # Also, specify Hz = 44100 (or whatever).
    #
    # That should be all you need; run the function and it will spit out a list
    # of coefficients [c0, ... c(N-1)] where N is your tap count. When you run
    # this filter, your output signal y[t] will be computed from the input x[t]
    # like this (t-N means N samples before the current one):
    #
    # y[t] = c0*x[t] + c1*x[t-1] + ... + c(N-1)*x[t-(N-1)]
    #
    # After playing around with remez for a bit, it looks like numtaps should 
    # be above 100 for a solid filter. See what works out for you. Eventually, 
    # take those coefficients and then move them over and do the convolution 
    # in C or whatever. Also, note the gaps between the bands in the call to 
    # remez. You have to leave some space for the transition in frequency 
    # response to occur, otherwise the call to remez will complain.
