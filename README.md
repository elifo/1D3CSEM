# 1D3CSEM
One-dimensional (1D) three-component (3C) spectral element modeling (SEM) of seismic wave propagation in nonlinear media with pore-pressure effects. 

For details on how to use the code, please refer to [Manual](https://github.com/elifo/1D3CSEM/tree/main/MANUAL/manual.pdf).

## Content
The code is the extended version of the 1D SEM code of Dr. Elise Delavaud (Delavaud, 2007). I have implemented the following features:
* Three component analysis
* Incident velocity insertion by file
* Borehole boundary condition 
* New soil constitutive models that are based on:

    * Viscoelasticity of Liu and Archuleta (2006)
    * Nonlinearity of MPII model (Iwan, 1967)
    * Liquefaction front model of Iai et al. (1990)
